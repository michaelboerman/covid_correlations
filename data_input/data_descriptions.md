## Data Descriptions

The densities come from [UN Population Dynamics](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/) and are measured in 1000s.

The population count from [US Census yearly estimates](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-total-cities-and-towns.html), data [found here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2020/national/totals/) and is measured in 1000s. This is not used in the final "polished" code.

The covid death and case statistics come from the [COVID19 R Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/COVID19/index.html), which states the origin for these metrics as the [Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker).
